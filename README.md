# Interesting Links

I've found one of the more compelling reasons for using social media is to see what other media people are consuming. Specifically experts in a field. I've many articles, videos, and papers that I would have never discovered or found an interest in this way.

This is a *hopefully* simple attempt to isolate that benefit of social media. It's done in a manner that requires no cost to me or any future user.

## How to get Setup

1. Create a github and netlify account if you don't have
2. [![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://www.github.com/dustinknopoff/interesting-links)
3. You'll receive an email at the address you setup with netlify. 
4. Login.
5. This will take you to the Netlify CMS admin panel for your new site.
6. There are 2 sections `Links` and `My Interests`. 
7. `Links` are things you find interesting and would like to share with others.
8. `My Interests` is for *"following"* other people.
9. Starting adding and following!
